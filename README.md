![Cheetohs Logo](/client/src/assets/graphics/CheetohsLogo.png)


## Overview

_**Cheetoh Photo** is a photo library that allows users to view a gallery of images. Users with valid login credentials can add, edit, and delete images to and from the gallery. Images can be provided with captions, as well as commented on and liked by other users._

### Team Members

Created, designed, and developed by Aladdin Omar, Ash Rahman, and Corey Ferland (Git Czar) for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive (November 2019 - February 2020 Cohort) Unit 3 Project. 

### Team Expectations

## MVP

_The **Cheetoh Photo** MVP will provide a login and registration form to users, as well as forms for creating and editing new image posts within a gallery. There will also be an option to delete these posts. Users who are not logged in will be able to view the gallery but nothing else. There will be backend databases to store user credentials and the gallery contents._
